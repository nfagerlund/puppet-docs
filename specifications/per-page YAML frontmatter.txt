per-page YAML input v0.1
-----

This must be a valid YAML document, situated above the content of a page and separated from it by "---\n".

This must be present in each source file, and may be consulted to build the final document structures.
  (Having it mandatory is a limitation of Jekyll, not by design. But you'll almost always want to at least specify a title.)
Any extra keys beyond the ones specified below will be ignored.

---
title: "STRING",
subtitle: "STRING",
description: "STRING",
toc: (true|false),
formerly:
  VERSION: "(ABSOLUTE PATH | PATH RELATIVE TO BASE URL)",
  VERSION: ...
layout: "STRING",
canonical: "ABSOLUTE PATH"
tags: [ "STRING", ... ]
