Use the `puppet-enterprise-uninstaller` script to uninstall PE roles on a given node. This script can remove a working PE installation, or undo a partially failed installation to prepare for a re-install.

Using the Uninstaller
-----

The `puppet-enterprise-uninstaller` script is installed on the master, PuppetDB, and console nodes; you can run it with `/opt/puppet/bin/puppet-enterprise-uninstaller`.

You can also run the uninstaller from the same directory as the installer script; run it with root privileges from the command line:

    $ sudo ./puppet-enterprise-uninstaller

Regardless of the path you use, the uninstaller will ask you to confirm that you want to uninstall.

By default, the uninstaller will remove the Puppet Enterprise software, users, logs, cron jobs, and caches, but it will leave your modules, manifests, certificates, databases, and configuration files in place, as well as the home directories of any users it removes.

You can use the following command-line flags to change the uninstaller's behavior:

### Uninstaller Options

- **`-p`** --- Purge additional files. With this flag, the uninstaller will also remove all configuration files, modules, manifests, certificates, and the home directories of any users created by the PE installer. This will also remove the Puppet Labs public GPG key used for package verification.
- **`-d`** --- Also remove any databases created during installation.
- **`-h`** --- Display a help message.
- **`-n`** --- Run in `noop` mode; show commands that would have been run during uninstallation without actually running them.
- **`-y`** --- Don't ask to confirm uninstallation, assuming an answer of yes.
- **`-s`** --- Save an [answer file][answerfile] and quit without uninstalling.
- **`-a`** --- Read answers from file and fail if an answer is missing. See the [uninstaller answers section][uninstaller_answers] of the answer file reference for a list of available answers.
- **`-A`** --- Read answers from file and prompt for input if an answer is missing. See the [uninstaller answers section][uninstaller_answers] of the answer file reference for a list of available answers.

Thus, to remove every trace of PE from a system, you would run:

    $ sudo ./puppet-enterprise-uninstaller -d -p

Note that if you plan to reinstall any PE role on a node you've run an uninstall on, you may need to run `puppet cert clean <node name>` on the master in order to remove any orphaned certificates from the node.
