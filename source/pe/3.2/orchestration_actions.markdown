About This Page
-----

This page is a comprehensive list of Puppet Enterprise (PE)'s built-in orchestration actions. These actions can be invoked on the command line or in the PE console.

> ### Related Topics

> * For an overview of orchestration topics, see [the Orchestration Overview page][fundamentals].
> * To invoke actions in the PE console, see [Navigating Live Management](./console_navigating_live_mgmt.html).
> * To invoke actions on the command line, see [Invoking Actions](./orchestration_invoke_cli.html).

Actions and Plugins
-----

Sets of related actions are bundled together as **MCollective agent plugins.** Every action is part of a plugin.

A default Puppet Enterprise install includes the [package](#the-package-plugin), [puppet](#the-puppet-plugin), [puppetral](#the-puppetral-plugin), [rpcutil](#the-rpcutil-plugin), and [service](#the-service-plugin) plugins. See [the table of contents above](#content) for an outline of each plugin's actions; click an action for details about its inputs, effects, and outputs.

You can easily add new orchestration actions by distributing custom MCollective agent plugins to your nodes. See [Adding Orchestration Actions](./orchestration_adding_actions.html) for details.
