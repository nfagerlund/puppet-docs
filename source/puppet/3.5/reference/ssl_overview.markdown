Puppet's network communications and security are all based on the standard HTTPS (HTTP over TLS/SSL) protocol, which uses X.509 certificates to secure traffic and authenticate nodes.

Puppet includes its own certificate authority (CA) tools to provide PKI functionality to a deployment, although an existing CA can also be used.
