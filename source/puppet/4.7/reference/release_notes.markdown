This page lists the changes in Puppet 4.6 and its patch releases.

Puppet's version numbers use the format X.Y.Z, where:

* X must increase for major backwards-incompatible changes
* Y can increase for backwards-compatible new functionality
* Z can increase for bug fixes

## If you're upgrading from Puppet 3.x

Read the [Puppet 4.0 release notes](/puppet/4.0/reference/release_notes.html), since they cover breaking changes since Puppet 3.8.

Also of interest: the [Puppet 4.5 release notes](/puppet/4.5/reference/release_notes.html) and [Puppet 4.4 release notes](/puppet/4.4/reference/release_notes.html).
