## Make sure you're ready

Before installing Puppet on any agent nodes, make sure you've read the [pre-install tasks](./install_pre.html) and [installed Puppet Server][server_install].

> **Note:** If you've used older Puppet versions, Puppet 4 changed the locations for a lot of the most important files and directories. [See this page for a summary of the changes.][where]

## Review supported versions

{% include pup43_platforms_windows.markdown %}

> **Deprecation Note:** Puppet 4.2 deprecated Windows Server 2003 and 2003 R2. The Windows installation packages for `puppet-agent` 1.4.0 and above, which contain Puppet won't install on those versions of Windows Server.

To install on other operating systems, see the pages linked in the navigation sidebar.

## Download the Windows `puppet-agent` package

[Puppet Labs' Windows packages can be found here.][downloads] You need the most recent package for your OS's architecture:

* 64-bit versions of Windows can use `puppet-agent-<VERSION>-x64.msi` (recommended) or `puppet-agent-<VERSION>-x86.msi`.
* 32-bit versions of Windows _must_ use `puppet-agent-<VERSION>-x86.msi`.

These packages bundle all of Puppet's prerequisites, so you don't need to download anything else.

The list of Windows packages might include release candidates, whose filenames have something like `-rc1` after the version number. Use these only if you want to test upcoming Puppet versions.

## Install Puppet

You can install Puppet [with a graphical wizard](#graphical-installation) or [on the command line](#automated-installation). The command-line installer provides more configuration options.

### Graphical installation

[server]: ./images/wizard_server.png

Double-click the MSI package you downloaded, and follow the graphical wizard. The installer must be run with elevated privileges. Installing Puppet does not require a system reboot.

During installation, you will be asked for the hostname of your Puppet master server. This must be a \*nix node configured to act as a Puppet master.

For standalone Puppet nodes that won't connect to a master, use the default hostname (`puppet`). You might also want to install on the command line and set the agent startup mode to `Disabled`.

![Puppet master hostname selection][server]

Once the installer finishes, Puppet will be installed, running, and at least partially configured.

### Automated installation

Use the `msiexec` command to install the Puppet package:

    msiexec /qn /norestart /i puppet-agent-<VERSION>-x64.msi

If you don't specify any further options, this is the same as installing graphically with the default Puppet master hostname (`puppet`).

You can specify `/l*v install.txt` to log the installation's progress to a file.

You can also set several MSI properties to pre-configure Puppet as you install it. For example:

    msiexec /qn /norestart /i puppet-agent-<VERSION>-x64.msi PUPPET_MASTER_SERVER=puppet.example.com

See [the MSI Properties section](#msi-properties) for information about these MSI properties.

Once the installer finishes, Puppet will be installed, running, and at least partially configured.

### MSI properties

These options are only available when installing Puppet on the command line (see above).

The following MSI properties are available:

MSI Property                                                   | Puppet Setting     | Introduced in

#### `INSTALLDIR`

Where Puppet and its dependencies should be installed.

> **Note:** If you installed Puppet into a custom directory and are upgrading from a 32-bit version to a 64-bit version, you must re-specify the `INSTALLDIR` option when upgrading.
>
> If you are replacing 64-bit Puppet with a 32-bit version, you should **uninstall** Puppet before installing the new package. Be sure to re-specify any relevant MSI properties when re-installing.

Puppet's program directory contains the following subdirectories:

Directory   | Description
------------|------------
bin         | scripts for running Puppet and Facter
facter      | Facter source
hiera       | Hiera source
mcollective | MCollective source
misc        | resources
puppet      | Puppet source
service     | code to run puppet agent as a service
sys         | Ruby and other tools

**Default:**

When using the architecture-appropriate installer, Puppet installs into `C:\Program Files\Puppet Labs\Puppet`.

If you install the x86 package on a 64-bit system, it will install into `C:\Program Files (x86)\Puppet Labs\Puppet`.

#### `PUPPET_MASTER_SERVER`

The hostname where the Puppet master server can be reached. This sets a value for [the `server` setting][s] in the `[main]` section of [puppet.conf][].

**Default:** `puppet`

> **Note:** If you set a _non-default_ value for this property, the installer **replaces** any existing value in [puppet.conf][]. Also, the next time you upgrade, the installer re-uses your previous value for this property unless you set a new value on the command line. So if you've used this property once, you shouldn't change the `server` setting directly in [puppet.conf][]; you should re-run the installer and set a new value there instead.

#### `PUPPET_CA_SERVER`

The hostname where the CA Puppet master server can be reached, if you are using multiple masters and only one of them is acting as the CA. This sets a value for [the `ca_server` setting][c] in the `[main]` section of [puppet.conf][].

**Default:** the value of the `PUPPET_MASTER_SERVER` property

> **Note:** If you set a _non-default_ value for this property, the installer **replace** any existing value in [puppet.conf][]. Also, the next time you upgrade, the installer re-uses your previous value for this property unless you set a new value on the command line. So if you've used this property once, you shouldn't change the `ca_server` setting directly in [puppet.conf][]; you should re-run the installer and set a new value there instead.

#### `PUPPET_AGENT_CERTNAME`

The node's certificate name, and the name it uses when requesting catalogs. This sets a value for [the `certname` setting][r] in the `[main]` section of [puppet.conf][].

For best compatibility, you should limit the value of `certname` to only use lowercase letters, numbers, periods, underscores, and dashes. (That is, it should match `/\A[a-z0-9._-]+\Z/`.)

**Default:** the node's fully-qualified domain name, as discovered by `facter fqdn`.

> **Note:** If you set a _non-default_ value for this property, the installer **replaces** any existing value in [puppet.conf][]. Also, the next time you upgrade, the installer re-uses your previous value for this property unless you set a new value on the command line. So if you've used this property once, you shouldn't change the `certname` setting directly in [puppet.conf][]; you should re-run the installer and set a new value there instead.

#### `PUPPET_AGENT_ENVIRONMENT`

The node's [environment][]. This sets a value for [the `environment` setting][e] in the `[main]` section of [puppet.conf][].

**Default:** `production`

> **Note:** If you set a _non-default_ value for this property, the installer **replaces** any existing value in [puppet.conf][]. Also, the next time you upgrade, the installer re-uses your previous value for this property unless you set a new value on the command line. So if you've used this property once, you shouldn't change the `environment` setting directly in [puppet.conf][]; you should re-run the installer and set a new value there instead.

#### `PUPPET_AGENT_STARTUP_MODE`

Whether the Puppet agent service should run (or be allowed to run). Allowed values:

* `Automatic` (**default**) --- Puppet agent starts with Windows and stays running in the background.
* `Manual` --- Puppet agent won't run by default, but can be started in the services console or with `net start` on the command line.
* `Disabled` --- Puppet agent is installed but disabled. You must change its startup type in the services console before you can start the service.

#### `PUPPET_AGENT_ACCOUNT_USER`

Which Windows user account the Puppet agent service should use. This is important if the Puppet agent needs to access files on UNC shares, since the default `LocalSystem` account cannot access these network resources.

* This user account **must already exist,** and can be a local or domain user. (The installer allows domain users even if they haven't accessed this machine before.)
* If the user isn't already a local administrator, the installer adds it to the `Administrators` group.
* The installer also grants the [`Logon as Service`](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms813948.aspx) privilege to the user.

This property should be combined with `PUPPET_AGENT_ACCOUNT_PASSWORD` and `PUPPET_AGENT_ACCOUNT_DOMAIN`. For example, to assign the agent to a domain user `ExampleCorp\bob`, install with:

    msiexec /qn /norestart /i puppet-agent-<VERSION>-x64.msi PUPPET_AGENT_ACCOUNT_DOMAIN=ExampleCorp PUPPET_AGENT_ACCOUNT_USER=bob PUPPET_AGENT_ACCOUNT_PASSWORD=password

**Default:** `LocalSystem`

#### `PUPPET_AGENT_ACCOUNT_PASSWORD`

The password to use for the Puppet agent's user account. See the notes under [`PUPPET_AGENT_ACCOUNT_USER`](#puppetagentaccountuser).

**Default:** no value.

#### `PUPPET_AGENT_ACCOUNT_DOMAIN`

The domain of the Puppet agent's user account. See the notes under [`PUPPET_AGENT_ACCOUNT_USER`](#puppetagentaccountuser).

**Default:** `.`

#### Downgrades

If you need to replace a 64-bit version of Puppet with a 32-bit version, you must **uninstall** Puppet before installing the new package. You must also uninstall if you are downgrading from 3.7 or later to 3.6 or earlier.

### Uninstalling

You can uninstall Puppet through the "Add or Remove Programs" interface or from the command line.

To uninstall Puppet from the command line, you must have the original MSI file or know the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa370854(v=vs.85).aspx">ProductCode</a> of the installed MSI:

    msiexec /qn /norestart /x puppet-agent-1.3.0-x64.msi
    msiexec /qn /norestart /x <PRODUCT CODE>

When you uninstall Puppet, the uninstaller removes Puppet's program directory, the Puppet agent service, and all related registry keys. It leaves the [confdir][], [codedir][], and [vardir][] intact, including any SSL keys. To completely remove Puppet from the system, manually delete the confdir, codedir, and vardir.
